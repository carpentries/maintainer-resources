### Agenda

#### 1. Introductions

#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team
* Python lesson Maintainers (and other Maintainers with Python experience) please read through and add your thoughts on this issue: <https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/issues/1049>
* Upcoming "AI Carpentry" curriculum discussions:
    * What should be taught in a "Developer Workshop"? Monday 21st July & Wednesday 30th July. See <https://pad.carpentries.org/community-sessions-2025> for timings and sign up.
        * how to build and train machine learning models
    * What should be taught in a "User Workshop"? Sessions coming in August.
        * how to (potentially) use (generative) AI for developing


#### 3. General Information

- What to do with orphaned figures after lesson changes?
    - Challenge is that some people rely on them for other purposes
    - Maybe put them in [Carpentries Commons](https://github.com/carpentries/commons) folder and share information widely about plan

#### 4. Special discussion: *Lesson Accessibility*

- Does Carpentries have offical accessibility targets (like [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/))?
    - No. Many accessibility features are built into the Workbench infrastructure and we try to use UDL to make lessons as accessible as possible, but there's no official target.
    - A good aspirational goal is WCAG 2.1 AA (see link above)

- Structure
    - Use nested heading levels, not text formatting, for sections etc
- Contrast
    - [Inline code snippets](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/97)
        - :point_up: this has _not_ yet been merged and feedback from Maintainers is encouraged
    - Contrast checkers https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
- Menu navigation
    - `File - New Incognito Window` or "File - New Incognito Window" (no clear guidance in style guide yet)
        - Old issue referring to old style guide: [datacarpentry/OpenRefine-SocSci#130](https://github.com/datacarpentry/openrefine-socialsci/issues/130)
- Images
    - Alt-text, captions, text descriptions, and text in images
        - See https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images
        - Not great example https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-spreadsheets/fig/good_formatting.png 
    - Special cases
        - Images of tables (try to build table in md/rmd instead)
            - https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-spreadsheets/blob/main/episodes/02-common-mistakes.md?plain=1
        - Screen captures (esp. for non-programming lessons)
            - only capture the part of the window that is important to show
            - use the "naive" view, i.e., with as few customisations as possible, for screen captures
            - try to keep window styles similar throughout a lesson
            - example to consider: first (non-twitter) screenshot in [this episode](https://datacarpentry.github.io/r-intro-geospatial/02-project-intro.html#introduction)
                - tricky because it's meant to portray something overwhelming
                - but your learners will probably be trying to read
                    - some things that could help would be shrinking the space between columns, using a smaller directory, only capturing part of the window, or possibly using another tool like `tree` in BASH to convey the same information with less cognitive overhead
        - Data visualization
            - Describe basics of figure, including key pedagogical purpose (why is it here in the lesson), avoid details of scales etc
            - [More on alt text for data viz](https://a11ykat.medium.com/see-the-unseen-mastering-alt-text-for-images-and-charts-6d3dbe36553b)

- Tips:
    - You don't need to fix everything in the whole lesson at once for accessibility; make a plan (if you see a need) and work through it as you can
    - Whenever you add or update an image, make sure to fix the alt-text too
    - Create one pull request per episode when fixing accessibility issues, to keep review doable

- article on accessible data viz: Crameri, F., Shephard, G. E., & Heron, P. J. (2020). The misuse of colour in science communication. Nature communications, 11(1), 5444.

### For next meeting

- Wednesday, 20 August, 2025
- Topic ideas?
    - incubator and lab differences from official lessons and what to know
