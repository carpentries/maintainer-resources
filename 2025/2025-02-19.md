### Minutes

#### 1. Introductions (5 min)

#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team
- Opt-in process update
    - 77 responses (~100 current Maintainers)
    - We will try to contact others directly
    - 15 responders stepping down
    - Next step: begin assessing Maintainer capacity for each lesson, prepare call for new Maintainers to join Onboarding
    - Onboarding sessions expected in late March or April
- Workbench update(s)
    - Blog post describing Toby's approach to debugging lesson builds: https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/02/debugging-lesson-builds/ 
    - Overhaul of Workbench documentation planned for later this year
- Lesson Software Setup Instructions task force update(s)
    - Recommendations have been drafted, to be published at beginning of March
    - Most changes will affect the central setup instructions included in the https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template repository, but some changes will be needed on individual lessons
    - Look out for pull requests on your lessons to implement the changes
- Please add the `open-educational-resources` tag to your lesson repository
    - This will list the lesson on [OERSI](https://oersi.org/resources/pages/en/)
        - "a search index for Open Educational Resources in higher education"
    - To add the tag: click the gear wheel button :gear: next to the _About_ box on the right-hand side of the repo home page, and type open-educational-resources into the "Topics" field.
- Maintainer Handbook FAQs:
    - [A new section in the Maintainer Handbook, for frequently-asked questions](https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/maintainers.html#faq)
    - Currently contains the "social norms" guidance discussed in recent Maintainers meeting:
        - What to do when somebody seems to have abandoned their PR?
        - What to do when somebody said they would open a PR and then went silent?
        - I guess, how long should the AWOL be before we figure they are abandoned? 6 months? 12 months? 
    - What are we missing? What other questions would you like to have answered in the Maintainer Handbook?
       - What to do for big changes when an issue requires attention from a Curriculum Advisory Committee? A: (tag the committee)
       - how to become the CAC or restart one thats gone awol 

#### 3. General Information
- Debugging workbench lesson builds
- Co-authoring commits
    - [Learn about how to add co-authors for commits](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/commit-together-with-co-authors/)
    - Ensures that everyone involved with a change gets credited
    - Related to [the "social norms" guidance](https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/maintainers.html#when-and-how-should-i-take-over-somebody-s-unfinished-contribution) discussed above
    - Q: is it necessary to add a co-author if making changes to an original PR? That should automatically provide credit
      - If changes happen on the original branch it should be fine, but it is more robust to different situations to add co-authors
      - if you use line suggestions in review mode and those are accepted, you are automatically added as co-author without needing training
    - typical co-author situations also include when contributors open issues suggesting specific changes (i.e. to typos or text) would be good to add original suggester as co-author on the PR
    - **Ultimately, when and how to add co-authorship is up to the maintainer's judgment**
- Additional general questions and discussion
    - Q: What is the status of possible plans for updating Python ecology to match R upgrades?
        - Toby: multiple maintainers from Python ecology are stepping down, so we would like to combine call for maintainers for that lesson with project of upgrade (e.g. get volunteers who are excited about the big changes)
        - A few mantainers for Spanish lessons met with Toby this week to discuss potentially moving translations to Crowdin. Not sure if it's a good idea to try and coordinate changes.
    - Toby: with implementation of social norms guidance in Handbook, there is an opportunity to create a bot to check for and bump or close stale requests
        - If anyone would like to try and create something like that, please contact Toby (tobyhodges@carpentries.org, or send me a message on Slack)

#### 4. Special discussion
- Focus on items in `general information` above
- If time allows: preparing for transition out of maintainer role
    - (If you have the time) this transition period is a great time to close issues and PRs, try to clean up the repository a bit to "prepare the ground" for the new Maintainers.
    - Curriculum team will check in the next few weeks how many PRs are open across repositories. If you have a lot of PRs open, the team may try to come in and close or merge some to make it easier for new maintainers to come on
    - Jon: there are a couple kinds of issues that are easy to close
        - 1. This is outdated and doesn't need dealt with
        - 2. Where there are a bunch of related issues that can be edited slightly and close a bunch with 1 pull request

- Q: Have a super stable repo (OpenRefine) and the issues were very easy, wanted to leave them open to welcome new instructors or maintainers. But how to "open" are are the newcomers with access?
    - Nathaniel - can be really difficult if you haven't been folowing the conversation the full time. Ok as Maintainer to summarize the conversaion in a new issue. Make sure to use #issuenum to link the original issue. John - yes, also link back to the original issues. 
- Issues that are big overhauls of the curriculum that are 10 years old. Require CAC approval. 
- Organizing information is an accomplishment! 
- Asking Github Copilot "can you summarize all the open issues in this repo?" - only did the first 10 issues. 

### For next meeting

- March 19, 2025
    - We will definitely have updates on maintainers stepping down and the onboarding recruitment process should have already begun
    - Please reach out with additional questions or ideas for topics (Slack, DM, email)
