### Minutes

#### 1. Introductions (5 min)

#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team (15 min)

- Maintainer Impact Reports will be shared this week. 
    - Plan to prepare these annually. 
    - They will be sent to the primary email address associated with your profile in [AMY](https://amy.carpentries.org/)
    - First step in the annual Maintainer onboarding/offboarding cycle
    - We will share the (very) short "opt in" survey with Maintainers next week, where you can tell us if you plan to stay on as a Maintainer or step away from the role
- The Carpentries will be an independent 501\(c\)3 non-profit organization effective 1 February! [Learn more from the blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/new_year_message_from_exec_team/)
- Workbench updates
    - no updates released since December meeting
    - if you work on any lessons in The Carpentries Incubator that still use the previous infrastructure, you will need to migrate to the Workbench (or transfer your repository out of the Incubator) by the end of 2025. Learn more about this, and how the Curriculum Team can help you migrate your lesson(s) in the blog post: <https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/01/sunsetting-styles-support-incubator/>
- Curriculum and funding updates
    - The Curriculum Team will be coordinating development of a new "Research Data Management" lesson pathway for Library Carpentry in 2025. More details to be announced on the blog soon.

#### 3. General Information

- Handbook update - [when to merge your own PRs](https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/maintainers.html#when-should-i-merge-my-own-pull-request)
    - guidance for Maintainers to help them decide when they should merge their own pull requests, e.g. if other Maintainers or Core Team members have not responded to a request for a review.

#### 4. Special discussion - BYO Issue

- Today's special topic time is reserved for you to bring issues or PRs that you're working on and would like to discuss with fellow maintainers because you...
    - Are looking for advice
    - Need to find someone with technical expertise
    - Want to brag on yourself or your fellow maintainers or contributors

- Topics/issues raised (links encouraged)
    - Jamie: new workbech is a lot easier than old styles setup
    - Jia Qi Beh (LC Intro to R) want to try to break current structure into smaller chunks
        - advice on best apporach to breaking episodes down into sub pages?
            - don't try to combine other changes with splitting episodes in a single pull request (keep substance and structure edits separate)
        - how to edit time for episodes etc
            - summary and setup page is combination of index.md, learners/setup, and (for instructor view) episode headers
            - edit yaml headers in each episode
        - consult https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/ for instructions on how to install the Workbench infrastructure on your local system, and to use that to build local previews of your lesson website. This will save you a lot of time when making big structural changes like splitting up episode files.
    - Marco: work made it challenging to contribute much last year but more flexibility this year
        - This is fine and we appreciate whatever you can contribute
    - Nathaniel: how best to work when making multiple changes across a lesson, to get these back into the lesson in a pull request. E.g. restructuring to put episodes in a different order, or adding alt-text to images throughout lesson. Best ways, in terms of reducing friction for pull requests, branching, avoiding conflicts, etc.
        - Toby: big communications element
            - e.g. if working on alt-text across lesson, could work over months without any conflicts arising because images don't change much but would still be worth consulting with others about how preferred pull request
            - for things like changing episode names/order, there are likely to be merge conflicts (which are generally your responsibilities if you're a maintainer) --> make sure that all other open PRs are merged/closed before you start reorganising, and communications might be required to freeze lesson content and prepare/merge as quickly as possible to avoid conflicts

#### 5. Other conversation
 
- Jose: Do people report if they teach incubator lessons (and should they) (and how)?
    - Answer: There is a form on the [Incubator webpage](https://carpentries-incubator.org/) and past workshops reported through it can be found on [Github](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/carpentries-incubator.org/tree/main/_data/workshops), but it's often not used
    

### For next meeting
