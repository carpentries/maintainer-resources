### Minutes

#### 1. Introductions (5 min)

- Icebreaker: what is a great low-cost (e.g., less than dinner out) gift you've been given?

#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team

- Maintainer opt-in results
    - 92% response rate -- **thank you** to everyone who responded!
    - 82 continuing, up to 28 retiring
    - only one lesson with no continuing maintainers (R ecology)
- Maintainer onboarding process updates
- Lesson setup [taskforce report](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/03/lesson-setup-instructions-task-force-recommendations/)
    - PRs incoming
    - New recommendation for WSL in Git/Bash lessons (will still have instructions for Git for Windows)
    - Python
        - move to recommend miniforge instead of Anaconda
            - will also require discussing environments in lesson
        - adding optional setup instructions for VSCodium/VSCode as IDE (alternative to Jupyter)
- [AI advice](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder/pull/697)
    - PRs incoming
    - Ongoing discussion on PR and in topicbox discuss-list (ideally contribute via topicbox to avoid duplicate conversation in different lessons)
    - Question: do we need policy (possibly CoC changes) related to use of AI to coauthor lesson material etc
        - related question: could there be licensing issues if AI is drawing from code repo with more restrictive (e.g. not public domain) licenses
- [Docker image](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/issues/39#issuecomment-2725213235)
    - Testers needed
    - Schedule call if desired with Rob to do testing! https://calendly.com/froggleston
    - You will still be able to run the packages locally if you do now (it will be a new option)
    - Question: could we use docker for lesson setup
        - Answer: yes, but should we (because that would mean people don't have the experience of setting up the software on their own machine)
- Incoming pull requests about generalist repositories

#### 3. Special discussion (if time)

- Micro coworking sprint (find a straightforward issue or PR on your lesson and try to finish it off)
    - Unmute if you would like feedback from someone (since we won't be looking at Zoom)
        - Looking for alternative R-related link connected to https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-intro-geospatial/issues/161
    - Community lead will check in around every 5 minutes for comments/questions/asks
    - Report accomplishments (merged/closed/updated issues and PRs here)
        - *Example: Instructor Training [Issue 1795](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues/1795)* (closed as complete!)
        - Started work on [DC OpenRefine for SocSci issue 177](https://github.com/datacarpentry/openrefine-socialsci/issues/177)
        - matlab-novice-inflammation [Issue 244](https://github.com/swcarpentry/matlab-novice-inflammation/issues/244) closed with comment.
        - Created pull request https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-data-intro/pull/244 and worked on closing issue https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-data-intro/issues/210
        - Second meeting had less things finished but multiple important discussion/feedback moments about issues/PRs
