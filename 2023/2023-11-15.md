## Notes:

### 1. Introductions (5 min)

Why did you become a maintainer?
- I need to develop the lesson for my job
- it seemed fun and a good way to learn
- it required less time commitment than teaching workshops
- was using LC Git lesson to improve Git skills and kept making comments, voluntold to be maintainer
- Got into maintenance by forcing herself to use the thing that she teaches all the time. 
- - Didn't really understand how maintenance worked, so joined to get a better idea of that
Became maintainer to improve skills on GitHub and as a way to return something from what I received from the community
- Wanted to contribute to the community as an RSE.

### 2. Updates from Carpentries team (15 min)
- New maintainer community lead - Nathaniel Porter
    - maintainer of instructor training
    - excited about this!
- Next maintainer meeting is **2nd** Wednesday in December (13-Dec) not 20-Dec due to Winter holidays
    - see the [community calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events)
- Search function in workbench lessons still pending
    - workaround: use `site:` search syntax ([DuckDuckGo example](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=checkout+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcarpentries.github.io%2Finstructor-training%2F))

### 3. Other Questions & Topics
- Reviving co-working corrals?
    - Previously first Wednesday [14:00-16:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Monthly+Meeting&iso=20231206T14) but time can change or have multiple
    - idea was to provide opportunity for Maintainers to work on their repositories alongside others, share experience, compare notes, discuss maintenance, etc.
    - Idea to have topical focus for some (i.e. R, Library Carpentry, Ecology, etc.)
        - people maintaining lessons on the given topic could get together to discuss similar issues and determine shared approach
        - could be triggered by input from Curriculum Team or Curriculum Advisory Committees, but could be scheduled based on availability/responses to a poll etc
        - or we could focus them around tasks e.g. labeling issues, looking at old issues & PRs, etc
    - what is the interest?
        - some expressions of interest from Maintainers during 2023 onboarding and recent GitHub skill-up sessions, certainly seems worth asking the question to the whole community e.g. sending out a poll to the TopicBox
        - multiple people interested at meeting

### 4. Special topic: Quick wins for maintainers
- [Slides](https://codimd.carpentries.org/z3HQ_nN_RXKwkmG4NPYgHQ?both)

- Meeting 1
    - What do other Maintainers do to make a difference in a limited amount of time?
        - biggest challenge is often dealing with stale issues and trying to reinvigorate (Toby)
            - often person that opened issue or PR doesn't follow up - when you as maintainer step in and just do/merge yourself
            - what do you do to ensure progress gets made on issues/PRs?
        - Try to get to state where can merge maybe not perfect but good enough but document issue for future reference on how to improve later
        - How can we communicate as maintainers (and how long to wait) that others can open PRs or improve them when originators don't follow up?
            - having a specific label could help to indicate this
        - issues and PRs tend to come in pairs. we should think about how to teach people to create better issues.
            - we recently intoduced new issue templates that explicitly ask contributors to say where a problem is located (see https://github.com/datacarpentry/image-processing/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=suggest_improvement_2_episode.yml for an example)
    - Issue/PR model doesn't require lots of maintainers but works best with regular interaction between maintainers
    - Labels are really helpful for coordinating and helping things move
        - requires applying them and updating labels as things change (for example removing help wanted)
    - Another helpful thing: maintainers can edit title of issues to make it easier to see what needs done
        - What's ettiquete around retitling issue?
            - As long as in good faith, worth doing (but note in comment)
    - Recent suggestion that Carpentries introduce automated closure of issues after certain period of time inactive - thoughts?
        - Should be cautious - loses opportunity (Alber)
        - Would be nice to get rid of old issues but better to do by hand - check what's in and if still applicable to lesson - should be thought about (Sarah)
        - Is there a middle ground, where we could automate a reminder that goes out somewhere, checking for issues/PRs that have not had any engagement for a set amount of time, notifies maintainers?
    - Maintainer meetings could be used to bring up tricky PRs or issues as well

- Meeting 2
 - Erin has example of urgent issue: several years ago, ggplot2 had an extensions gallery that they were hosting at one domain and later they moved it to a sub-domain of tidyverse [Zhian: we attempted to catalog this in the workbench, but didn't find a good way to do this yet](https://github.com/carpentries/pegboard/blob/e7e5c4555e13a09bf9f53ec903dc9c0a462ed789/R/validate_links.R#L313-L325). 
 - Erin: want to appreciate the advice around "assist". Hadn't brained this really before. Always thought about what can we complete instead of move along
 - Jennifer: In the slides, the idea of a label of "PR Requested". I have tried to respond with a link of how to create a PR in GitHub, but I don't know if I've ever gotten any engagement. I do like the idea of adding the label. This also gets tricky with two-pronged issues. 
 - Nathaniel: The label is really useful because that's a way for you to easily check if something needs to be addressed or if it's in progress. 
 - Nathanial: regarding two-pronged issues: adding checkboxes helps 
     - Zhian: checkboxes also create "convert to issue" box for each check box. Github presents a little circle with a dot inside it next to a checkbox, and if you click on that icon it will create a new issue right inside the same repository.
     - [ ] this is a checkbox
     - [x] this is a checked checkbox 
 - Discussion about strategies and approaches that Maintainers use
 - Lisa is a maintainer on two lessons. Question is that hard to balance the two lessons? Not really because the lc-overview lesson doesn't seem that substantial and the main activity around that has been about decommissioning that lesson because it's not that substantial or effective.
 - Active conversation in Curriculum Team about how the responsibility for Overview lesson is distributed. Would be interested to know how you would like to have it distributed
 - Having access to both leads to confusion 
 - tip from Zhian: you can use filters in gmail to sort by program or repo and skip inbox to make it easy to find when you're ready `list:(<repo>.<org>.github.com)`, example: `list(lc-git.librarycarpentry.github.com)`

### 5. For next meeting (5 min)
- Reminder: December 13th (2nd Wednesday)
- Send topic ideas in slack or email
    - Current ideas: 
        - helping contributors turn their issues and PRs into merge-ready changes
        - building effective collaboration between maintainers
        - pre/post issue/PR discussion (talk about ongoing or successful challenges)
        - better understanding of the github workflows and how they work
            - good starting place: https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/pull-request.html 
        - hearing about the maintainer survey and helping keep maintainers (especially ones who have taken on issues/PRs) engaged/connected
