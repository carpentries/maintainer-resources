### Agenda:

#### 1. Introductions (5 min)

- [Sandbox organisation: fishtree-attempt](https://github.com/fishtree-attempt)
    - carp-ent-try
    - Sandbox organisation for testing lesson transition to new infrastructure
    - Zhian is trying to mask all old links and references in commit messages
    - Please let Zhian know if you get any strange notifications about old commits or GitHub mentions
    - Repositories from alpha testing, we have a working website with extra commits removed in the git history

#### 3. Topic of the Month (30 min)

- RFC#19: Maintainer Guidelines: Yearly Check-ins for Maintainers
    - https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/19
    - You can opt-in if you miss the email
    - You will still be on all the communication channels, unless you take yourself out of it.
    - Luis: Was there any pushback to this?
    - Dan: For this particular thing, no.
    - Luis: would this also apply to incubator lessons?
    - Dan: All of this has been for the official lessons, but I think this depends on whether or not incubator lessons have a tag in AMY. I believe they are a separate thing. It seems simple enough that they can be included, but we can figure this out.

    - https://github.com/carpentries/maintainer-RFCs/issues/20
