        - Onboarding probably in March
        - Hopefully have committees in place by around April
        - **Would be great to have members of the maintainer community in these communities**
            - Maintainers have a useful perspective of health of lesson program
    - Important distinction between Curriculum Advisory Commitees and Lesson Program Governance Commitees
        - [Curriculum Advisory Committees (CACs)](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/curriculum_advisory_committees.html) advise on changes to lessons content
        - LPGCs deal more with communications and advocacy
    - Questions may be directed to Toby Hodges (tobyhodges@carpentries.org)
    - SWC and DC have no governance bodies ATM
    - Executive Council was formed from the steering commitees of SWC and DC
        - The EC has changed quite a lot in recent years, new members have experience in NGO Governance.
        - EC recently approved a new policy which describes the Governance Commitee for lesson programs. This committee will look at health and needs for the lesson program, and objectives/directions it needs to develop for the future. Responsibilities will involve advocacy of representing lesson program in local community, and to the executive council. One area of focus is communications, e.g. blog posts, short reports that the EC should be aware of.
    - [Look out for the blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/) with more detail - should be published this week, maybe even today

#### 3. Topic of the Month (20 min)

- Transition to Workbench Beta Phase
- Beta phase is currently running
- A handful of lessons are transitioning to the new infrastructure
    - https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/11/dovetail-011/#lessons-currently-in-the-beta-phase
    - [Dovetail #11](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/11/dovetail-011/)
- Full rollout of the new lesson infrastructure expected in April next year
- About the Workbench: https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/
- About the beta phase: https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/beta-phase.html
    - The beta phase will last for about 3 months, during which there will be two websites for the lesson
    - First part: parallel websites and parallel repositories
    - Second part: merge things together (overwrite repositories)
        - **Must have all PRs closed by this step**, otherwise PRs will point to a branch that doesn't exist
- Maintainer feedback is essential in this process
- See an example of a lesson using the Workbench: https://preview.carpentries.org/r-socialsci/
- Lesson website layout and styling has changed, and source repositories have been reorganised with some folders and files removed altogether
    - tooling for lesson construction, validation and styling is no longer kept in the lesson repository
    - see https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/transition-guide.html for a comparison between old and new infrastructure
    - Beta phase is a chance for Maintainers to to try out this new repository structure, the setup for building and previewing lessons locally, and the new Markdown syntax for writing lessons, and give feedback on what is working and what could be improved.
- Workbench Office Hours - walk through what the changes are and support people working on these lessons
    - Toby Hodges can also support people with the Workbench
    - Contributing to the Workbench, and how that looks like
    - Mostly you will only need to know Markdown -- choice for R and Pandoc is that they're multiplatform, and we can spend less time worrying about setup
- Question: Workbench's backend is in R, do we need to know R to work with it?
    - Not at all, on the Workbench Docs there are [setup instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/#setup) for different operating systems, and it is compatible with other development environments, e.g. VS Code, Vim.
    - Syntax on the new template will be much closer to CodiMD, GitHub Markdown, than to the Jekyll syntax.
    - Should work with the last ~5 versions of R, there is also the option of RStudio Cloud, and a Docker image.
- Previews:
    - [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/#setup)
    - [R for Social Scientists](https://preview.carpentries.org/r-socialsci/)
- An important feature of the Workbench is that it is going to be easier to show contributors for a lesson
    - GitHub contributor graphs will show people that have contributed to the lesson content
        - The previous template showed commits from the Styles repository, so it was difficult to identify people working on the lesson
        - Example: [old](https://github.com/sgibson91/cross-stitch-carpentry/graphs/contributors) vs [new](https://github.com/zkamvar/transition-cross-stitch-carpentry/graphs/contributors)
