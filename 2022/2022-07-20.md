#### 3. Topic of the Month (30 min)
- How to generate lesson citations?
  - It's complicated! Lesson citations should be based on lesson publications, *i.e.* the release of a specific version or tag, but there currently isn't a standardised process for lesson publications. This raises important questions such as how to define authorship in lesson publications/citations?
  - Lessons should have "freezes" and a release cycle. There are proposals in place for this to happen, but it's a work-in-progress.
      - That is useful indeed; then you could mention that you're teaching a specific version of the lesson.
  - If you need a citation file right away, please use the CFF -- [citation file format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) -- template.
- What is the Carpentries Workbench?
  - It's the [new lesson infrastructure template](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/01/live-lesson-infrastructure/).
  - The Carpentries is moving on to the beta phase, you can sign up for it by discussing your co-maintainers and contacting Zhian (zkamvar [at] carpentries.org)
  - More updates on the beta phase will happen after CarpentryCon -- stay tuned to blog post updates.
- Curriculum Advisory Committee
    - Calls are open to become a Curriculum Advisor -- please see the [blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/06/curriculum-advisor-committee-applications/). If you are interested, please fill in [the application](https://forms.gle/4ZLq1mh74r98AeeN9).
- Follow-up on discussion about lesson release cycles
    - Automated with a script (previously Python/Bash-based, will become R-based)
    - Old release process: https://github.com/swcarpentry/swc-releases
        - Ideally should be 6 months, but takes a lot of work from the community
    - Will be done before the transition to the Workbench beta phase
- Style changes and the new template
    - Transitioning to the Workbench will not alter the content of the lessons
    - Workbench beta phase has been put on hold
        - Happy to accept applications, but may have to wait for a little bit
    - It's important to merge/close pull requests before the transition
    - Can lessons in other languages apply to the workbench beta phase?
        - Yes!
- The Carpentries blog is a great resource for keeping up with community updates
    - The [#Dovetail](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-dovetail) blog post series has very descriptive and informative updates about the Workbench.

#### 4. Current Maintainer Request for Comment (RFCs): (15 min)

#### 6. Questions from Co-working session

#### 7. For next meeting
