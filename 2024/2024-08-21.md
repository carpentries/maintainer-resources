### Minutes:

#### 1. Introductions (5 min)

#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team (15 min)

* [Lesson Setup Instructions Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/2024/lesson-setup/lesson-setup-instructions.md)
    * evaluating potential changes to software setup
    * Anaconda change in terms of service is particular issue
        * Anaconda allowed for educational purposes, but terms may require paid plans for research use
        * Alternatives are available, but would need implemented
    * Also may include considering alternatives to Git Bash for Windows (WSL)
    * Task force will evaluate options and make recommendations

* OpenRefine may need alternatives as well for people who can't install locally

#### 3. General Information

* Significant updates
    * SWC Git
        * git checkout replaced with git restore
        * [replacing dracula with recipes](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/pull/1003) is ready but needs publicity before launch
        * request to make sure instructor trainers/trainees are informed as this launches to make sure people know for demos

4. Other issues raised
- Spreadsheets (DC socsci) lesson - instructs people to download/open CSV file to do work in lesson but don't like that learners have to open CSV file because differences in factors between office software, region, etc [(Git issue)](https://github.com/datacarpentry/spreadsheets-socialsci/issues/114#issuecomment-2303050609)
- OpenRefine (and other lessons using CSV in spreadsheets) - Excel behaves very differently depending on version and how you open ("Open" vs "Import")
    - Also of note (Nathaniel will add issue eventually) that LC openrefine exported data opens incorrectly in Excel because it may not detect unicode in author names columns
- bigger question here - does switching from CSV to XLSX interfere with preference for non-proprietary formats (and connects to setup task force potential to need to explain why it's valuable to use/prefer FOSS and fully open data types)
    - maybe in that case csv discussion should be earlier in the lesson?
- OpenRefine hosting/installation
    - still ongoing issues with locked-down work computers
    - There is an example of a hosted version at [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:OpenRefine) “OpenRefile is available as a cloud service on PAWS to Wikimedia users. ”

### For next meeting
**Wednesday, 18 September**
* Topic suggestions
    * review who has ownership over what kind of changes
    * maybe Toby can ask someone with Git lesson to talk about case study of how those changes have been made
