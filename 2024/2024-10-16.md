## 1. Introductions (5 min) *How do you (or how would you like to be able to) demonstrate the impact of your work as a maintainer?*

- First meeting
    - not really applicable/comparable in my case, as working on Carpentries lessons and other things is part of my job. Last year, after the Collaborative Lesson Development Training program launched, I did pull tgether some statistics about overall contributions on that repository, issues closed, PRs merged etc.
    - Report how much I've contributed (I guess N of PRs/merges/issues?) as well as how often lessons are used
    - Impact reports for major changes/upgrades with something to document
    - Not relevant where I am now, but valuable experience for a CV (future employers)
- Second meeting 
    - I like to think about the number of people reached by the lesson. 
    - I feel too new to have made an impact yet.(this is marijane) but I did merge the pull request this week!
    - Contributions (# PR merges and issues solved/engaged with)
    - Associated comments related to changes made to gauge benefits

## 2. Updates from Carpentries team (15 min)

- Maintainer impact reports
    - Preparing emails to all Maintainers with statistics:
        - number of workshops where lesson was taught
        - web analytics data, e.g. unique page visits
        - traffic on repository, e.g. numbers of issues and PRs opened on repo, number merged,closed, contributed to, etc
    - What other information would you like to receive about your lesson repositories/maintainer activity?
- Redesigned Carpentries website launching in November, new handbook coming in December
    - Question: will the handbook also be translated into Spanish or other languages?
        - Carpentries team will check, but it's hard to validate policy translations without a native speaker
        - It may be especially important to have the Code of Conduct available in any languages for which we have official curriculum, regardless of if the whole handbook is translated (so every workshop has a code of conduct in its language)
- Infrastructure updates
    - Sandpaper 0.16.9
        - You may have received notifications that lesson builds were failing
        - Latest release of sandpaper fixes build errors related to removal of R from Ubuntu image
        - 0.16.9 was released yesterday, after the regular weekly scheduled run of the `Update Workflow Files` workflow: if you do not want to wait until next Tuesday for a pull request to update your workflows based on version 0.16.9, navigate to the _Actions_ tab of your lesson repository, select the `Update Workflow Files` workflow from the menu on the left, and select _Run workflow_

## 3. General Information

- Tip for making lessons translation-friendly
    - Avoid mid-sentence line breaks (previously used to limit number of characters on a line in code)
    - These are no longer necessary (soft-wrapping can be done in GitHub and code editors) and make the initial automated translation of lessons less accurate by breaking up sentences/thoughts
    - We now recommend one sentence per line

## 4. Special discussion 

- Discussion in section 2 above about maintainer impact reports

## 5. Other issues raised

- What if other maintainers can't be reached to approve my pull request after a while?
    - You can reach out to curriculum team (including Erin Becker and Toby Hodges) or maintainer community lead (Nathaniel Porter)
    - For small changes (typos etc) you can also merge yourself
