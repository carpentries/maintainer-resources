### Minutes

#### 1. Introductions (5 min)

#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team (15 min)

- New [maintainer handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/maintainers.html#maintainers-handbook)! (and lots of [other handbook/s](https://docs.carpentries.org/) as well)
- Upcoming workbench release features:
    - improvements to error messages
    - playing nice with new pkgdown
    - option for disabling sidebar episode numbering
    - adding support for custom licenses
        - Currently hard-coded to CC-BY
- [Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org) has now been retired
    - site is still up, but pages now link out to other resources (main community handbook, lesson development training curriculum, Workbench documentation) where the info that used to be hosted in the CDH can now be found.

#### 3. General Information

- Be patient if waiting for review this month
    - Many maintainers and core team are out of the office between this week and the 2nd-3rd week of January
    - the Core Team can be reached for emergencies (malicious redirect, site completely down, etc.) on #general Slack channel or team@carpentries.org email

#### 4. Special discussion 

- Familiarizing ourselves with the new handbook (and finding errors/improvements or things missing)
  - Links:
        - [The Maintainers Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/handbooks/maintainers.html#maintainers-handbook)
        - [List of Curriculum Resources](https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/)
  - Toby: the page listing our standard set of issue labels, and describing how to programmatically add them to a repository, is currently missing. I will open a PR to add it back in this week.
  - contrast should be higher on top-bar buttons (including the outline button when viewing Zoomed in or at low resolution)
  - link to maintainers TopicBox list in Maintainers handbook should include a note that visitors will have to be logged in to be able to view the list
  - we should add links to Instructor Training, Maintainer Onboarding where approrpiate e.g. in list of Maintainers' repsonsibilities
  - guidance for manually triggering maintenance workflows should be moved to a separate resource, linked from Maintainers and Lesson Developers' handbooks
    - swap order of recommendations for notifying people about a period of absence
      - and clarify what sort of thing is meant by "temporary absence" (e.g. to distinguish from only checking weekly or biweekly but something that changes so you're fully away)
    - A missing curriculum resource (which Toby is working on!) is a page describing the overall ecosystem of Carpentries curriculum stuff -- the Incubator, Lab, official lesson programs, Workbench, etc and how all of that fits together.
  - Can/should we say something about Git/Github training in here?
    - Maybe a revised version of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvWhSYBkZJ0 if we don't want to link directly to the skill-up
    - Should there be like a one-sentence explainer of the step by step guides section (something to the effect of the guides below may not be relevant to everyone, but they're important to have avaialble)?

- (if we have time): drafting some "social norms" for handling situations with unresponsive contributors https://codimd.carpentries.org/cJLkVN2_TLeS42mWqn0Q4g?edit
    - Erin G: Pretty much in line with what I've been doing
    - Alison: I like the "looking for contributors" label
        - Nathaniel: will we use it sufficiently and differently from help wanted?
    - Will this be in the maintainer handbook or somewhere else?

#### 5. Other issues raised
 
- Braden: question about TopicBox. There are lists for individual curricula, etc. Are there other lists that are recommended or advisable for Maintainers to join/pay attention to?
  - TopicBox not as active as Slack, a long tail of channels that have almost no activity, and some that have quite a lot of traffic. What channels/lists you should join really depends on interest, geographical location, etc
-David: feels like curriculum should be shortened up (Python Ecology) kind of like R, but would that involve CAC for that big a change?
  - Would make sense to be made more consistent with the R curriculum
  - Irene: want to follow this discussion re:Python Ecology in Spanish
  - David: it would be great to have a sprint
  - Nathaniel: IT maintainers have also used instructor notes and the `instructor` folder (to add a page under `more`)
    - [Example](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/18-preparation.html)
