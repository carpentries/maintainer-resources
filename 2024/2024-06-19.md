### Minutes:

#### 1. Introductions/icebreaker (5 min)

*When did you first realize you needed to learn to code or do research computing, and what did it feel like?*

#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team (10 min)

- Introducing Oscar Masinyana, Communications Manager
    - Resource for help with communicating related to Carpentries (Slack is best way to reach), email is oscar.masinyana@carpentries.org (or just send to team@carpentries.org)
- New Maintainers [announced on the blog today](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/06/welcome-maintainers/)
    - You should have received an email introduction already. Please help them get settled in!
- Workbench: 
    - reminder to review and merge PRs opened by carpentries-bot to update dependencies and workflow files on your lessons
    - new Workbench release this week includes Dark Mode (thanks to Dimitrios Theodorakis) 
    - and configurable web analytics (only collected by default for official Carpentries lessons but can be configured to your own analytics tools in other workbench lessons)

#### 3. General Information

- OpenRefine discussion session on instructor notes was today 15:00 UTC (https://pad.carpentries.org/community-sessions-2024)
    - If you are interested in hosting a maintainer-related work session or discussion on a tool or topic, Slack or email Nathaniel with an idea and some times that might work for you
    - There is some challenge on understanding/communication on community events (maybe work with Oscar)
    - Marijane it was a good reminder to show up for community calls as an experienced instructor
- Non-Carpentries items of note for some maintainers
    - numPy (Python) 2.0 [potentially breaking release](https://numpy.org/devdocs/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html)
    - [posit::conf](https://posit.co/conference/) for R/Quarto/etc users 12-14 August (free for academic virtual attendance)

#### 6. Topics/Lesson issues to discuss (please add links to the issues you'd like feedback or insight on) (30 min)


- [How to ensure lessons work for a global audience](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-data-intro/issues/225)
     - related question: should we encourage core team members that submit issues to do PRs (given the demands on them?)
         - welcome to ask but they may not have much time and it's a little different than trying to get people to engage for the first time
     - to the original question: yes US numbers aren't the only approach but we may not want to add more complexity
     - **biggest problem is that there's no explanation of US phone number formats (assumption that people understand)**
     - maybe add some examples?
     - alternative might be email addresses or something else more standard

- How to deal with [issue recommending adding more formulas to clarify exercise](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/issues/1077) - how much should we clarify/explain/add?
    - some of the fenced div classes can be used to add information like this 
        - Hint or instructor note might be helpful
    - seems like explaining same thing in another way, not adding, so may be good here
    - or might be a good opportunity to link out to something else
    - maybe add and link to glosario but per suggestion above it's important not to make people feel unprepared/excluded
    - So how to resolve? (any of the below)
        - Open a PR to make change
        - reopen issue with another response on how to address, add help wanted
        - reopen and invite original contributor
        - leave closed

- If added to your DC lesson but also overview repo - should you go ahead and work on things that come up there too?
    - Yes, in many DC lessons, the overview is co-maintained by the other lesson maintainers
    
- Best ways to work with older issues that may or may not need addressing (should we apply labels, comments, both?)
    - It's really up to your workflow - labels are mostly used by maintainers (other than help wanted)
    - If you close an issue, some kind of comment is useful as to why, but otherwise, those are optional too

- discussion of things that have become harder/less obvious for newer generations of learners
    - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5 (ChatGPT is bullshit paper)
    - https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z (Genz can't file things)

- what to do about Dracula and Wolfman ([new discussion on very old issue](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/issues/277#issuecomment-2167728282) in software carpentry Git lesson whether it should be swapped for another example)
    - Why change? (summary of past reasons)
        - culturally specific
        - not code-related
        - possibly problematic (predatory on young children)
        - a bit weird and not relatable
    - LC Git is different (shorter, different example) so less relevant here
        - mostly focused on setup and connection to computer
        - alternate approach is to use Github Desktop https://github.com/ndporter/lc-git-gui
        - UCSB custom approach: https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ 
    - Next steps?
        - If maintainers all agree on direction, can bring it to CAC and/or look for community volunteers to help with transition
        - Changes would need to go through SC CAC before updating

- *What if we started a Carpentries book club?* (maybe start with [The Programmer's Brain](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain)) 

- Question: is it ok to cross-post to multiple relevant channels in Slack?
    - Yes! It's good
    - How: post in one then use the more dots on that post and copy link to a post in new channel

###### Next meeting
