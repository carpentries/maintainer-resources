### Agenda:

#### 1. Introductions (5 min)

*(Icebreaker) What is your top pet peeve to see in writing, code, or Git(hub)? (e.g. what is something that bothers you, possibly more than is reasonable, whenever someone does it?)*

- programs that take a long time but do not provide any feedback about what they're doing
- all the extra words in writing
- insufficient documentation +1
- when people use the default "Apply suggestions from review" or other uninformative commit message on GitHub
- poor documentation or instructions that simply do not work
- Bad error messages
- drs0 = q0 + 5.0 * lc
- inconsistent number of # when commenting
- unnecessarily complex code that makes it more difficult for beginners to understand
- unreasonable: commas/semicolons are important and I'm just sloppy with them.  Also, I don't practice enough (md or sandpaper).  And where does the Setup live in my lesson?  I feel it's the hardest page to locate and update because there isn't a link to edit from the web.



#### 2. Updates from Carpentries team (15 min)

- Plans for implementing and using Citation File Format (CFF) for lesson repositories
    - CFF is a machine-readable file format for describing how software (or anything) should be cited
    - Supported by GitHub, Zenodo, Zotero, other tools
    - [CFF support](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/aio.html#helping-people-cite-your-lesson) introduced to the Workbench last month
    - Recommended in Collaborative Lesson Development Training
    - Blog post to be published soon with recommendations for how to implement on open source lesson repositories
    - Planned rollout across DC, LC, SWC lessons in 2025 -- delay due to time it will take to prepare CFFs for 60+ lessons
    - What will CFF for lessons enable?
        - More visibility & credit for lesson Maintainers and contributors
        - Better lesson metadata -> better findability, interoperability of lessons/curricula
        - Easier, more frequent+regular lesson releases
    - Regular lesson releases: could we (should we?) move to a yearly release cycle?
        - replace rolling updates with structured cycle, e.g. 
            - collect feedback/suggestions -> 
            - identify changes/updates to be made for next release -> 
            - coordinated effort to address those points -> 
            - pre-release 'freeze' of lesson content -> 
            - release to Zenodo -> 
            - repeat ^
        - pros: 
            - potential to improve experience for Instructors
            - provide mechanism and structure for larger updates (current model encourages minor changes only)
            - could facilitate lesson internationalisation efforts
        - cons: 
            - requires a big shift in how we operate: culture change + process change
            - requires a large chunk of work to automate processes around lesson releases
        - feedback:
            - how would decisions be made on updates? There may be a lot of major changes being considered
            - structured releases may help with deadlines and clearing up some latent issues
            - bigger stuff may be "above my pay grade" as a maintainer, both in amount of effort and level of necessary coordination (and/or when to just do things)
            - makes sense as long as there's a plan and sensible numbering system etc
            - allows people to see what's changed between major versions
            - versions can make it easier to keep track and even refer to lesson you are doing (or have done)
            - may help improve prioritization of changes
            - especially valuable for internationalization and instructor checkout (secondary uses that rely on knowing when things will change)
            - versioning might also allow people to select versions of lessons based on the software versions available to them

#### 3. General Information

- What to do when your Git Actions runs fail?
    - Ask on Slack and take advantage of community experience!
        - [Example](https://carpentries.slack.com/archives/C3KUTT5V3/p1720802411013659) (must be member of Carpentries Slack workspace to view)
        - [Another recent example]( https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-explainable-ml/issues/3), where the infrastructure was not providing helpful feedback about what is going wrong:
    - Then reach out to core team or maintainer lead if needed

#### 4. Topics/Lesson issues to discuss (please add links to the issues you'd like feedback or insight on) (20 min)

- Is there a list of all the maintainers? So we can see our fellow maintainers handles and emails? Or those for another lesson?
    - List of all maintainers: https://carpentries.org/maintainers/
    - canonical list of official lesson maintainers is table on lesson program (SC/DC/LC) "Lessons" page and this is generally most up to date
    - Each lesson should have an updated list in the readme.md but they are not always current
    - Part of reason for question is getting in touch with maintainers for another lesson
- Pull request generated by automated processes (e.g. sandpaper version update - https://github.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson/pull/613). Since all tests passed, can I just merge it? Or is there any other check that needs to be done?
    - Yes - PRs that come from `carpentries-bot` can generally be merged immediately (which may also prevent failed builds)
- Question on merging PRs
    - Is it better to do a squash merge or direct merge commit?
    - There's no explicit recommendation or defined culture but typically we just use merge commits
- If move happens toward regular releases, how much support will there be?
    - We wouldn't do it if we didn't have strong support to avoid increasing work
- When to close an issue that has been discussed and feels like nothing's going to happen?
    - If it no longer applies, comment and close
    - If it's still being discussed, keep it open unless an alternative has been decided, then close with comment
    - If discussion is no longer active but nothings been done, it's really up to maintainers
- How can you see the proposed changes in the lesson (as built) for a PR?
    - When tried to build branch got error because not on main
- Genomics and AWS (note from experience) - what if you have a PR that requires testing with the code
    - Message Erin if you need AWS access/computes
